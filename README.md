# Olympic Data Analysis Dashboard  
This project is an interactive data analysis dashboard that explores 120 years of Olympic history (1896–2016) using Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit.
It allows users to visually analyze how the Olympics have evolved — from the number of participating nations and athletes to medal counts and gender participation over time.

<p>Built with Python and Streamlit, this dashboard helps users:</p>

<p>View country-wise medal tallies by year or event.</p>

<p>Analyze overall Olympic statistics, such as total editions, sports, and athletes.</p>

<p>Explore country-wise performance trends and top athletes.</p>

<p>Understand athlete-wise insights, including age distribution, height vs weight, and male vs female participation trends.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to transform raw Olympic data into meaningful insights and visual stories.</p>
